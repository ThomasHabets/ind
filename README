Why the name 'ind'?
-------------------
If it makes you feel better, you can think of it as meaning
"Indent to make reading output Not-Difficult".

Example uses
------------
Ex1
---
$ ind ls; ind ind ls
  Makefile
  README
  ind
  ind.1
  ind.c
  ind.yodl
    Makefile
    README
    ind
    ind.1
    ind.c
    ind.yodl

Ex2
---
Let's say you're running a script that has several stages, each producing
some status output. Now you can indent the output from the substages.

<< snip >>
echo "Stage 1, reconfooberating the ablamatron..."
ind -p "--> " cat blah.txt

echo "Stage 2, burning image..."
ind -p "    " growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=randomcrap.img
<< snip >>

This will produce the output:
<< snip >>
Stage 1, reconfooberating the ablamatron...
--> This is a text file
--> with only text in it.
Stage 2, burning image...
    ...
    ...
    ...
<< snip >>
