Why the name 'ind'?
-------------------
If it makes you feel better, you can think of it as meaning
"Indent to make reading output Not-Difficult".


What does it do?
----------------
When you prefix a command with 'ind' every line that the program
outputs can be prefixed and postfixed by a short string.

Ind works best with normal line-based programs. It will work with
fullscreen programs such as less or emacs, but they will display a bit
weird. Usually it will look good after a redraw (Ctrl-L), but for ind
to work properly with fullscreen (ncurses) things it would have to
implement a terminal emulator (such as vt100). At the moment this is
outside the scope of ind.


Example uses
------------
Ex1
---
$ ind ls; ind ind ls
  Makefile
  README
  ind
  ind.1
  ind.c
  ind.yodl
    Makefile
    README
    ind
    ind.1
    ind.c
    ind.yodl

Ex2
---
Let's say you're running a script that has several stages, each producing
some status output. Now you can indent the output from the substages.

<< snip >>
echo "Stage 1, reconfooberating the ablamatron..."
ind -p "--> " cat blah.txt

echo "Stage 2, burning image..."
ind -p "    " growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=randomcrap.img
<< snip >>

This will produce the output:
<< snip >>
Stage 1, reconfooberating the ablamatron...
--> This is a text file
--> with only text in it.
Stage 2, burning image...
    ...
    ...
    ...
<< snip >>
